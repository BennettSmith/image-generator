// What is aggregate roots here?

// Rules
// - Reference other aggregates by id
// - Changes are commited & rolled back as a whole
// - Changes to an aggregate are done via the root


// Prefer smaller aggregates (reduce amount of data to read/write in tx.)


// Aggregate modeling steps
// - Define each of the entities is an aggregate
// - Merge aggregates to enforce invariants
// - Merge aggregates that cannot tolerate eventual consistancy

// Domain events used to keep changes across aggregates consistent (eventually).
// Probably not used very often.

// - Does the entity make sense without the other?
// - Will it need to be looked up?
// - Will it be referenced by other aggregates?
