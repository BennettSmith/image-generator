# image-generator

Before you can run this example, you must create the image-generator-ios-app/.env file and add content like this:


```
#prefix IMAGE_GENERATOR

# Key for making Open AI API calls.
export IMAGE_GENERATOR_OPENAI_API_KEY={replace-with-your -open-ai-api-key>
```

This file is not included in the git repo for obvious reasons.
